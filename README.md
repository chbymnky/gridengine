# GridEngine
> A chrome extension that auto generates CSS styles for a grid based on the measurements entered for that grid.

## Grid Options
The extension allows you to choose from three different types of grids; Simple Grid, Complex Grid, & Ninja Grid.

### Simple Grid
Allows the user to create a simple layout mechanism to support something like a right or left hand sidebar. Typically
this is a main wider content arrea with a more narrow content area to one side or another of that larger content
area.

### Complex Grid
Allows the user to create a grid that will support multiple cloumns and a responsive setup. This calculates the
measurements entered to come up with marging gutter and column size based in the form of measurement designated.

### Ninja Grid
All the benefits of the complex grid but with adjustable mixins to allow the grid to be more flexible/addaptable to
breakpoint changes.
